 * \section ext_replay Replay Emulator Extension
 *
 * The replay extension allows you to record swadge inputs -- button presses, touchpad inputs,
 * and accelerometer readings -- to a file, and then play them back later. And when playing back
 * inputs, several special actions are also supported: starting fuzzing, taking a screenshot,
 * changing modes, and quitting the emulator. These must be manually added to a recording file,
 * but they can used to automatically target fuzzing to a specific screen, or to automatically
 * generate a screenshot of a specific screen.
 *
 * \section ext_format Recording File Format
 * If not given a custom name, recording files will be created in the current directory with the
 * name 'rec-TIMESTAMP.csv' As suggested by the name, this is simply a CSV file. The first line
 * contains the header, which specifies three columns: Time, Type, and Value. The rest of the lines
 * will be the individual input values or special actions.
 *
 * The first column, `Time`, is the timestamp, in microseconds, of the input. The next column,
 * `Type`, is the type of data or the special action to perform. Possible options are: `BtnDown`,
 * `BtnUp`, `TouchPhi`, `TouchR`, `TouchI`, `AccelX`, `AccelY`, or `AccelZ`, and `Screenshot`,
 * `Fuzz`, `SetMode`, and `Quit`.
 *
 * The third column, `Value`, depends on the value of the `Type` column. For `BtnDown` and `BtnUp`,
 * this is the name of the button: `A`, `B`, `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`, `Select`, or `Start`.
 * For all `Touch*` and `Accel*` types, the value is an integer. For `Screenshot`, the third column
 * is the filename for the screenshot, or it may be left blank for an automatically generated filename.
 * For `SetMode`, the value is the name of the mode to switch to. And, for `Quit` and `Fuzz`, the third
 * column is completely ignored.
 *
 * The following example recording file will generate a few button presses and touch events, then after
 * about 4 seconds, switch to Pong, take a screenshot, begin fuzzing until 10 seconds have passed, and
 * finally take another screenshot before closing the emulator.
