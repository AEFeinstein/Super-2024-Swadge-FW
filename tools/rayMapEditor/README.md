# Ray Map Editor

## Controls

Left click on tiles and objects in the palette on the left edge to select them.
Left click on the map to place the selected tile or object.

Right click on the map to see that cell's coordinate and optionally that object's ID in the right text box

Middle click on the map to drag the whole map around.

Load, save, or 'save as' the current map and scripts with the buttons on the top.

## Tiles

A map is a grid of tiles. The map size is configurable, but no larger than 255x255 tiles.
Each tile has a coordinate, where `{0.0}` is in the top left corner. The coordinate may be checked by right clicking on a tile.

Each tile on the map must have a background. Backgrounds are in the left column of the palette.
Background properties are intrinsic so wall types cannot be walked through, door types will open and close, etc.
You don't need to program properties of backgrounds.

Each tile on the may may also have an object. Objects are in the right column of the palette.
Object properties arse also intrinsic so item types will be picked up when touched, enemy types will move around and fight, etc.
Each tile starts with up to one object, though more can be spawned later.
Each object has an ID which *must* be unique, including the IDs of spawned objects.
IDs are automatically assigned when placing objects on the map, but must be manually assigned when using them in scripts.
An object's ID may be checked by right clicking on it.

## Scripts

Scripts define interaction in the map. Each script is comprised of an `IF` and `THEN` part.
`IF` defines what must happen for the script to trigger, i.e. kill some enemies or get an item.
`THEN` defines what happens when the script triggers, i.e. open a door or warp to a location.
Any `IF` may be paired with any other `THEN`.

### IF Operations

These are the conditions which can trigger scripts.

| Operation    | Value | Arguments                          | Description                                                                                                                                  |

### Script Element Syntax

These are the elements that are used for `IF` and `THEN` arguments.
Arguments, arrays, CELLs, and SPAWNs all have different delimiters to make parsing easier.

| Element   | Syntax          | Notes                                                           |

### Script Examples

If three enemies are killed in any order, open a door:
```
IF KILL(AND; [1, 2, 3]; ANY_ORDER; ALWAYS) THEN OPEN([{7.2}])
```
If three objects are shot in a specific order, spawn an energy tank:
```
IF SHOOT_OBJS(AND; [41, 42, 43]; IN_ORDER; ONCE) THEN SPAWN([{OBJ_ITEM_ENERGY_TANK-99-42.45}])
```
When a specific item is gotten, win the game:
```
IF GET (OR; [99]; ANY_ORDER; ONCE) THEN WIN()
```
If an item is touched, then warp to map 3, cell {2.1}:
```
IF TOUCH (OR; [3]; ANY_ORDER; ONCE) THEN WARP(3; {2.1})
```
When four walls are shot in a specific order, kill some enemies:
```
IF SHOOT_WALLS (AND; [{1.1}, {1.2}, {1.3}, {1.4}]; IN_ORDER; ONCE) THEN DESPAWN([5, 6, 7, 8])
```
When a room is entered from either of two ways, close the doors behind the player:
```
IF ENTER (OR; [{42.39}, {42.51}]; ANY_ORDER; ALWAYS) THEN CLOSE([{42.38}, {42.52}])
```
After a minute, tell the player a minute has elapsed:
```
IF TIME_ELAPSED(60000) THEN DIALOG(One minute has elapsed!)
```
