 * \section p2p_design Design Philosophy
 *
 * p2pConnection is a connection protocol with a little bit of message reliability that sits on top of ESP-NOW.
 * Think of ESP-NOW like UDP, where you can quickly and unreliably broadcast and receive packets, and p2pConnection as TCP, which trades some speed for reliability.
 * p2pConnection messages have sequence numbers for deduplication, are acknowledged, and are retried if not acknowledged.
 * 
 * Connections are made when two Swadges broadcast connection messages to each other, then send start messages to each other, and acknowledge each other's start message.
 * The play order is determined by who acknowledges the start message first, which is suitably random.
 * A connection sequence looks like this:
 *
 * @startuml{conn_seq.png} "Connection Sequence"
 * == Connection ==
 * 
 * group Part 1
 * "Swadge_AB:AB:AB:AB:AB:AB" ->  "Swadge_12:12:12:12:12:12" : "['p', {mode ID}, 0x00 {P2P_MSG_CONNECT}]"
 * "Swadge_12:12:12:12:12:12" ->  "Swadge_AB:AB:AB:AB:AB:AB" : "['p', {mode ID}, 0x01 {P2P_MSG_START}, 0x00 {seqNum}, (0xAB, 0xAB, 0xAB, 0xAB, 0xAB, 0xAB)]"

 * @enduml
 * 
 * After connection, Swadges are free to send messages to each other.
 * An example of unreliable communication with retries and duplication is as follows.

 * \section p2p_usage Usage
 *
 * p2pSendCb() and p2pRecvCb() must be called from the ESP-NOW callbacks to pass data to and from p2p.
 * 
 * p2pInitialize() should be called to initialize p2p.
 * p2pDeinit() should be called when the Swadge mode is done to clean up.
 * 
 * The connection won't actually start until p2pStartConnection() is called.
 * Connection statues will be delivered to the Swadge mode through the 
 * 
 * p2pGetPlayOrder() can be called after connection to figure out of this Swadge is player one or two.
 * 
 * p2pSendMsg() can be called to send a message from one Swadge to another.
 * 
 * p2pSetDataInAck() can be called to set up data to be delivered in the next acknowledge message.
 * This is useful for high-bandwith transactional messages.
 * For example, one Swadge may send it's button state to the other, and receive the game state in the acknowledge message.
 * This turns four messages (button state, ack, game state, ack) into two messages (button state, ack[game state]).
 * Note that the acknowledge message with data is not acknowledged itself, but the Swadge sending the inital message will retry until it receives the acknowledge.
 * p2pClearDataInAck() can be called to clear the data to be sent in the acknowledge.
 *
