 *
 * \section emuExt_intro Emulator Extensions
 *
 * Emulator extensions are structs made of callbacks that interface with the emulator to
 * allow functionality to be easily extended without modifying the emulator itself.
 *
 * Any callback functions that are not needed may be set to \c NULL and they will be ignored.
 * Details on the behavior and usage of each of these callbacks is available in ::emuExtension_t.
 *
 * \section emuExt_usage Usage
 *
 * An extension is created by defining an ::emuExtension_t struct. Aside from some restrictions
 * which may be described in each callback function's documentation, these functions are free
 * to make use of any exposed emulator state and functionality to enhance the swadge emulation.
 * These extension may even render to the screen using ::emuExtension_t::fnRenderCb and the drawing
 * functionality in \c "rawdraw_sf.h". If \c paneLocation, \c minPaneW, and \c minPaneH are all
 * non-zero, the extension will be assigned a dedicated pane where it can draw anything.
 *
 * In order for the callback to be loaded by the emulator, the callback must be added to the list
 * in \c emu_ext.c and any command-line arguments required must be added to \c emu_args.c.
 *
 * \section emuExt_example Example
 *
 * This extension will simply log everything that happens and draw a frame counter in a small pane
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * #include "emu_ext.h"
 *
 * static void exampleExtInit(emuArgs_t* emuArgs);
 * static void exampleExtPreFrame(uint64_t frameNum);
 * static void exampleExtPostFrame(uint64_t frameNum);
 * static int32_t exampleExtKey(uint32_t keycode, bool down);
 * static bool exampleExtMouseMove(int32_t x, int32_t y, mouseButton_t buttonMask);
 * static bool exampleExtMouseButton(int32_t x, int32_t y, mouseButton_t button, bool down);
 * static void exampleExtRender(uint32_t winW, uint32_t winH, uint32_t paneW, uint32_t paneH, uint32_t paneX, uint32_t
 * paneY);
 *
 * const emuExtension_t exampleExt = {
 *     .name            = "Example",
 *     .paneLocation    = PANE_BOTTOM,
 *     .minPaneW        = 50,
 *     .minPaneH        = 50,
 *     .fnInitCb        = exampleExtInit,
 *     .fnPreFrameCb    = exampleExtPreFrame,
 *     .fnPostFrameCb   = exampleExtPostFrame,
 *     .fnKeyCb         = exampleExtKeyCb,
 *     .fnMouseMoveCb   = exampleExtMouseMove,
 *     .fnMouseButtonCb = exampleExtMouseButton,
 *     .fnRenderCb      = exampleExtRender,
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * And then in \c emu_ext.c, add it to the list:
 * \code{.c}
 * // Extension Includes
 * // ...
 * #include "example_ext.h"
 *
 * static const emuExtension_t registeredExtensions[] = {
 *     ... // Existing extensions
 *     exampleExt,
 * };
 * \endcode
