 * \section btn_design Design Philosophy
 *
 * This component handles both push-buttons and touch-pads. Push-buttons are physical, tactile buttons while touch-pads
 * are touch-sensitive areas on the PCB. Events from push-buttons and touch-pads are processed different ways, but
 * queued in the same queue.
 *
 * The Swadge mode needs to call checkButtonQueueWrapper(), which calls checkButtonQueue() to receive queued button
 * events. The reason for checkButtonQueueWrapper() is so that the main loop can monitor the button which can be held
 * down to return to the main menu. The event contains which button caused the event, whether it was pressed or
 * released, and the current state of all buttons. This way the Swadge mode is not responsible for high frequency button
 * polling, and can still receive all button inputs.
 *
 * In addition to acting as binary buttons, the touch-pads may act as a single, analog, touch sensitive strip. These two
 * ways of reporting are not mutually exclusive.
 *
 * \section pbtn_design Pushbutton Design Philosophy
 *
 * The push-buttons are polled continuously at 1ms intervals in an interrupt, but these readings are not reported to the
 * Swadge modes. The interrupt saves the prior ::DEBOUNCE_HIST_LEN polled button states and the last reported button
 * state. When all ::DEBOUNCE_HIST_LEN button states are identical, the interrupt accepts the current state and checks
 * if it different than the last reported state. If there is a difference, the button event is queued in the interrupt
 * to be received by the Swadge mode.
 *
 * The push-button GPIOs are all read at the same time using <a
 * href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.0.1/esp32s2/api-reference/peripherals/dedic_gpio.html">Dedicated
 * GPIO</a>.
 *
 * Originally the push-buttons would trigger an interrupt, but we found that to have less reliable results with more
 * glitches than polling.
 *
 * Button events used to be delivered to the Swadge mode via a callback.
 * This led to cases where multiple callbacks would occur between a single invocation of that mode's main function.
 * Because the Swadge mode didn't have a separate queue for button events, this caused events to be dropped.
 * Instead of forcing each mode to queue button events, now each mode must dequeue them rather than having a callback
 * called.
 *
 * \section tpad_design Touch-pad Design Philosophy
 *
 * Unlike push-button polling, touch-pads use interrupts to detect events. When a touch-pad event is detected, an
 * interrupt will fire and the new event will be queued in the same queue used for push-buttons.
 *
 * In addition to acting as binary buttons, the touch-pad can act as a single analog touch strip. getTouchCentroid() may
 * be called to get the current analog touch value. Changes in the analog position are not reported
 * checkButtonQueueWrapper(), so getTouchCentroid() must be called as frequently as desired to get values. Do not assume
 * that changes in the analog position are correlated with events reported in checkButtonQueueWrapper().
 *
 * Touch-pad interrupts are set up and touch-pad values are read with <a
 * href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.0.1/esp32s2/api-reference/peripherals/touch_pad.html">Touch
 * Sensor</a>.
 *
 * \section btn_usage Usage
 *
 * You don't need to call initButtons() or deinitButtons(). The system does at the appropriate times.
 *
 * You do need to call checkButtonQueueWrapper() and should do so in a while-loop to receive all events since the last
 * check. This should be done in the Swadge mode's main function.
 *
 * You may call getTouchCentroid() to get the analog touch position. This is independent of checkButtonQueueWrapper().
 *
 * \section btn_example Example
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * // Check all queued button events
 * buttonEvt_t evt;
 * while(checkButtonQueueWrapper(&evt))
 * {
 *     // Print the current event
 *     printf("state: %04X, button: %d, down: %s\n",
 *         evt.state, evt.button, evt.down ? "down" : "up");
 * }
 *
 * // Check if the touch area is touched, and print values if it is
 * int32_t centerVal, intensityVal;
 * if (getTouchCentroid(&centerVal, &intensityVal))
 * {
 *     printf("touch center: %lu, intensity: %lu\n", centerVal, intensityVal);
 * }
 * else
 * {
 *     printf("no touch\n");
 * }
 * \endcode
