 * \section bzr_design Design Philosophy
 *
 * The buzzer is driven by the <a
 * href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/api-reference/peripherals/ledc.html">LEDC
 * peripheral</a>. This is usually used to generate a PWM signal to control the intensity of an LED, but here it
 * generates frequencies for the buzzer.
 *
 * A hardware timer is started which calls an interrupt every 5ms to check if the song should play the next note.
 *
 * This component manages two tracks, background music (bgm) and sound effects (sfx).
 * When bgm is playing, it may be interrupted by sfx.
 * If bgm and sfx are playing at the same time, both will progress through their respective notes, but only sfx will be
 * heard. This way, bgm keeps accurate time even with sfx.
 *
 * \section bzr_usage Usage
 *
 * You don't need to call initBuzzer() or deinitBuzzer(). The system does at the appropriate time.
 *
 * A ::musicalNote_t is a ::noteFrequency_t and a duration.
 * A ::song_t is a list of ::musicalNote_t that may be looped.
 *
 * The individual tracks may be muted with bzrSetBgmIsMuted() and bzrGetBgmIsMuted().
 *
 * A song can be played on a given track with either bzrPlayBgm() or bzrPlaySfx().
 * All tracks can be stopped at the same time with bzrStop().
 *
 * An individual note can be played with bzrPlayNote() or stopped with bzrStopNote().
 * This note is not on a specific track. It is useful for instrument modes, not for songs.
 *
 * MIDI files that are placed in the ./assets/ folder will be automatically converted to SNG files and loaded into the
 * SPIFFS filesystem. SNG files are lists of notes with durations and are compressed with Heatshrink compression. These
 * files can be loaded with loadSong() and must be freed with freeSong() when done.
 *
 * \section bzr_example Example
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * // Load a song
 * song_t ode_to_joy;
 * loadSong("ode.sng", &ode_to_joy);
 *
 * // Set the song to loop
 * ode_to_joy.shouldLoop = true;
 *
 * // Play the song as background music
 * bzrPlayBgm(&ode_to_joy);
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // Free the song when done
 * freeSong(&ode_to_joy);
 * \endcode
