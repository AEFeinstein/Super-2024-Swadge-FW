 *
 * \section font_design Design Philosophy
 *
 * Fonts are used to draw text to the display.
 * Each font is comprised of the ASCII characters from \c ' ' to \c '~'.
 *
 * All characters in the font have the same height.
 * Each character in the font may have it's own width.
 *
 * Each character is represented by a bit-packed bitmap where each bit is one pixel.
 * Characters may be drawn in any color.
 *
 * Fonts can be loaded from the SPIFFS filesystem with helper functions in spiffs_font.h.
 * Once loaded from the SPIFFS filesystem they can be used to draw text to the display.
 *
 * \section font_usage Usage
 *
 * drawText() is used to draw a line of text to the display. The line won't wrap around if it draws off the display.
 * drawTextWordWrap() can also be used to draw text to the display, and the text will wrap around if it would draw off
 * the display. This is more computationally expensive.
 *
 * drawChar() can be used to draw a single character to the display.
 *
 * textWidth() is used to measure the width of text before drawing. This is useful for centering or aligning text.
 *
 * textWordWrapHeight() is used to measure the height of a word-wrapped text block.
 * There is no function to get the height of text because it is accessible in ::font_t.height.
 *
 * \section font_example Example
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * // Declare and load a font
 * font_t ibm;
 * loadFont("ibm_vga8.font", &ibm, false);
 * // Draw some white text
 * drawText(&ibm, c555, "Hello World", 0, 0);
 * // Free the font
 * freeFont(&ibm);
 * \endcode
