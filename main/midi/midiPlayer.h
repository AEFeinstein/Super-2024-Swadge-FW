 * \section midiPlayer_design Design Philosophy
 *
 * This code is provided to play MIDI songs via the DAC speaker. MIDI songs are loaded
 * with midiFileParser.h.
 *
 * Two system-wide MIDI players are provided by default and can be used to playback
 * BGM and SFX independently. They will automatically be initialized if ::swadgeMode_t.fnDacCb
 * is \c NULL. Each MIDI player supports 16 channels and can simultaneously play up to
 * 24 melodic notes and 8 percussion notes, shared across all channels. All 128 General MIDI
 * instruments are supported, as well as the full General MIDI percussion range.
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * // Load a MIDI file
 * midiFile_t ode_to_joy;
 * loadMidiFile(ODE_MID, &ode_to_joy, true);
 *
 * // Play the song on the BGM channel
 * globalMidiPlayerPlaySong(&ode_to_joy, MIDI_BGM);
 *
 * // Pause both BGM and SFX
 * globalMidiPauseAll();
 *
 * // Unpause
 * globalMidiUnpauseAll();
 *
 * // Stop and save the player state
 * void* data = globalMidiSave();
 *
 * // Restore the player state
 * globalMidiRestore(data);
 *
 * // Get a pointer to a particular global MIDI player for advanced usage
 * midiPlayer_t* player = globalMidiPlayerGet(MIDI_SFX)
 *
 * // Turn on the sustain pedal for channel 1
 * midiSustain(player, 0, 0x7F);
 *
 * // Pitch-bend channel 3 down by one half-step
 * midiPitchWheel(player, 2, 0x1000);
 *
 * // Play an A3 note at half velocity on channel 3
 * midiNoteOn(player, 2, 69, 0x40);
 *
 * // Turn the note off
 * midiNoteOff(player, 2, 69, 0x7F);
 *
 * // Play a drum kit sound at full velocity on channel 10, which is reserved for percussion
 * midiNoteOn(player, 9, ACOUSTIC_SNARE, 0x7F);
