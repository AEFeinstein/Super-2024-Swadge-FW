 * Swadge hardware may have buzzers or a DAC driven speaker, but not both at the same time. These macros should be used
 * to play songs in a hardware-agnostic way. The configuration may be changed using <tt>idf.py menuconfig</tt> in the
 * "Swadge Configuration" menu's "Select Sound Output" option.
 *
 * See sngPlayer.h and hdw-bzr.h for the DAC speaker and buzzer respective functions that these macros route to.
