# Swadgimon

Pokemon, for the people! A homage to the Pokemon games (legally distinct though) based on MAGFest and the Gaylord National Harbor Hotel where the event is held.

#### Other name ideas:
- Swadgemon
- SwadgeWorld
- Pokeswadge
- PokeMAG
- MAGimon
- MAGmon
- Pokemon but legally distinct and better because it’s something WE created and it’s themed after our favorite festival that happens every year in National Harbor in January, yeah near DC, no it’s not in DC, no not MAGAfest, that’s Music And Gaming, just MAG with no A at the end, no this has nothing to do with magnets either
- Lanyard Monsters (Lanyamon)

## Versions

There are four versions of this game:
- Minimum Viable Product: The basics of the basics. Functional, but not what we wanted
- Level 1: Some stretch goals added in. Goal for 2025.
- Level 2: Expected output for the 2026 swadge
- Out-Of-Scope: The functions required for 1-1 equavalent with Gen III mechanics Not to be included unless someone has too much spare time.

[Example music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU263Ud3LM4&list=PL7B00075B92623D5D)

## Mechanics

The mechanics of the game are based on Gen III Pokemon games. As many mechincs that can be added should be added.

### Overworld

The overworld is an explorable environment that provides a lot of the context for the game. It should allow the player to slowly level up as they play and not smash them headfirst into impossible battles.

#### World

The world map is split into several zones, each with their own theme, music, etc. The map is split into a grid, and each grid space has a few values associated with it.

- Tile: One of 127 tiles (7 bit value)
- Tags: Water, Passable, Interactable, TallGrass, Door, On top of player, Transparant, Event, Ledge (9 bit value)
- InteractableID: ID of interactable object 16 bits, we're going to need more than 256.
- SpawnGroup: ID of spawngroup (8 bits)
- NewMap: New map to load if a door (6 bits)
- NewLoc: Location on new map (To account for multiple entrances) (2 bits)
- Event: If an event can happen, Event ID is store here (16 bits)

Each grid space will take up to 64 bits of data to store. Might be able to bitpack better once we determine number of zones, doors, interactables, etc. Also, we might be able to double use some things, like spawning areas may never have interactable items so those can overlap.

##### Interactables

Some impassable grid spaces are interactable. When an interaction is triggered (Pressing A when facing), the ID is checked and the associated action is called.

Examples:
- Dialogue: Signs, Monsters, People. Dialogue can be multiple pages, A advances, B retreats
- Items: Pick up and add to inventory
- Traversal options: E.G. Swimming across water requires inteacting with a body of water
- Use Moves in overworld: Flash, Cut, etc.
- Shops: Bring up a store menu

##### Spawngroup

Spawngroups are small data structures containing a list of spawnable monsters and what level they can spawn at

- ID: How a grid space references this item
- List of Spawnable monster IDs
- Level range (two 8 bit numbers) per spawnable monster

#### NPCs

NPCs are objects that block a grid space and can have monsters, dialogue, etc.

- Movement (Still, spinning, movement pattern, random (confined to an area))
- Monsters (0-6, if have none cannot initiate battle)
- Sprites (Overworld sprites, battle sprites)
- Entrance/lose/talk again dialogue 
- Attack patterns (How they pick moves for their monsters)
- Money earned by defeating their monsters

#### Story State 

The story state is a array of flags used to determine where the player is in the story. Grid tiles are checked when player steps on them or interacts, and those trigger flags.

Examples:
- Lock and key: snorlax with the flute
- Critical Dialogue
- Critical battles
- World changes: Ship leaving port, bridge breaking

#### Cutsceens

Player controls are largely stripped, and a scripted set of things can occur:
- Dialogue can spawn
- All NPCs, Player, and any Items can be moved
- A battle can be initiates.

### Menus

#### Swadgidex

Displays Species information for encountered and caught monsters, shows slot for all unencounted monsters to incentivize collecting.

#### Item Bag

Items can be used in battle or outside of battle, depending on the item. They are stored in an item bag. Some items can be held by monsters.

Different items go into different "pockets" so you can't run out of room for healing items by buying too many pokeballs.

Player also has a wallet.

#### Battle Order

Monsters can be swapped around to determine what order they come in when starting, or when one faints.

#### Monster storage

Monsters not in the player's party are sent to a storage PC.

#### Store menus

Store allow you to buy items. Inventory is controlled by inventory lists. Player must have the required money to buy items. Items can be batch-purchased.

### Monsters

Monsters are ther individual creatures caught and used to battle and navigate the environment.

#### Data structure

- Species
- Level
- 6 EVs
- 6 IVs
- Nature
- Move list (Up to 4)
- Nickname
- Gender
- EXP
- Pokeball used to capture
- Original trainer
- Personality value
- Pokerus Strain
- Pokerus Immunity timer
- Non-Volitile status
- Volitile status (In combat, can be multiple)
- Transient status (In combat)

#### Personality value

This randomly generated 32 bit number determins a few attributes of a monster:
- Gender (Lowest 8 bits)
- Ability: If two abilities are available, use the 1 place bit to pick
- Nature: Mod 25 of the entire number
- Shinyness: See [Shinies](#shinies)
- Size and weight: See [Personality value](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Personality_value)

#### Species

Each monster species has a few stats attached to them:
- Index
- Catch rate
- Base Experence yield
- EV yield (value and stat)
- Leveling rate
- Type 1
- Type 2
- Abilities
- Gender possibilities (Male, Female, Does not apply, etc.)
- Gender Ratio
- Height

- Sprite (Back)
- Sprite (Pokedex)
- Shiny Sprite (Facing)

- Monster cries
- Egg group 1
- Egg group 2
- Status immunities

#### Stats

There are six main stats:
- HP
- Attack
- Defense
- Special Attack
- Special Defense
- Speed

The formula for determining each of these is as follows:  
`HP = (2 * Base + IV + (EV/4)) * Level/100`
- Base: Monster Species base HP
- IV: See IVs below
- EV: See EVs below
- Level: Level of the monster

`All other stats = ((((2 * Base + IV + (EV/4)) * Level) / 100) + 5) * Nature`
- Base: Monster Species base stat
- IV: See IVs below
- EV: See EVs below
- Level: monster's level
- Nature: See natures below

##### IVs

Each stat is assigned a random IV at creation. The number varies from 0-31.

##### EVs

EVs are effort values. When an opposing monster faints, they give between 1-3 EV of a specific stat. The stat and value is based on species.

EVs have two hard caps:
- Individual: Highest any particular EV can go is 252 (it goes in increments of 4: each 4 of an EV adds 1 to its stat)
- Combined: The total of all EVs can only add up to 510

##### Natures

Natures are decided at creation. They have a positive trait and negative trait. There are 25 traits, but 5 of them cancel themselves out. Stats are increased or decreased by 10%

| Index | Nature | Increased Stat | Decreased Stat |
| ----- | ------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| 0  | Hardy    | Attack      | Attack      |
| 1  | Lonely   | Attack      | Defense     |

| 8  | Impish   | Defense     | Sp. Attack  |
| 9  | Lax      | Defense     | Sp. Defense |
| 10 | Timid    | Speed       | Attack      |
| 11 | Hasty    | Speed       | Defense     |
| 12 | Serious  | Speed       | Speed       |
| 13 | Jolly    | Speed       | Sp. Attack  |

| 22 | Sassy    | Sp. Defense | Speed       |
| 23 | Careful  | Sp. Defense | Sp. Attack  |
| 24 | Quirky   | Sp. Defense | Sp. Defense |

#### EXP

One a monster falls in battle, EXP is awarded to the other team's monsters that participated in taking it down that have not fainted.

##### EXP calculation

EXP awarded is measured by the following formula:  
`(b * L)/7 * 1/s * e * a * t`
- b: Base EXP value for the fainted monster
- L: Level of the fainted monster
- s: How many ways the EXP is split (Multiple monster participated)
- e: If monster is holding a lucky egg, 1.5. otherwise, 1.0
- a: If versus a trainer, 1.5. wild, 1.0
- t: If the monster was traded

##### Growth speed

Monsters exist in one of six EXP growth speeds, where n is the level of the monster _currently_.

1. Fast (4n^3)/5
2. Medium fast (n^3)
3. Fluctuating 
4. Erratic
5. Medium slow (6n^3)/5 -15n^2+100n-140
6. Slow (5n^3)/4

Erratic and Fluctuating have multi-part formulas as per below:

```
Erratic:
n < 50,         n^3(100-n)/50  
50 <= n < 68,   n^3(150-n)/100
68 <= n < 98,   n^3(1911-10n/3)/500
98 <= n < 100,  n^3(160-n)/100
```

```
Fluctuating:
n < 15,         n^3(n+1/3)+24/50  
15 <= n < 36,   n^3(n+14)/50
36 <= n < 100,  n^3((n/2)+32)/50
```

Example! Total EXP need for a Slow monster to reach level 58:  
(5*57)^3 / 4 =  5,787,281 EXP

##### Pokerus

After a battle, there's a chance for a monster to get Pokerus. Pokerus doubles EV gain for that monster permanently. There's an infectivity period, and after battle, the virus is likely to spread to other monsters adjacent in the battle order. Once infected, the monster will permanently gain double EVs.

- Strain: 4 bit number
- Catch chance: 3/65535 per battle
- Immunity timer: 1-4 days, even distribution (strain mod 4 + 1)
- Transfer chance: 1/3 to adjacent monsters in battle order
- At midnight, Immunity timer ticks down by one.

#### Shinies!

Shinyness is determined during creation.

The formula is `TrainerID XOR SecretID XOR Personailty value[31..16] XOR Personailty value [15..0]`
- TrainerID is a randomly assigned 16 bit value
- SecretID is... uh... Secret.
- Personality value is a random 32 bit number, split into top 16 bits and bottom 16 bits for the calculation

#### Breeding

When two monsters are left at a nursery, they do the sex and you get an egg.

Well, it's slightly more complicated than that...

Every 256 steps, a chance for an egg to hatch occurs. The likelyhood is determined be a few factors:
- Egg group: Monster must share an Egg group 
- Gender: Mechanics work like real life mammals. Consider expanding.
- Can't both be in ditto group
- Can't be in unbreedable egg group
- Oval charm increases chances

Assuming the above mechanics are satisfied:
| Egg chance | Species | Original Trainer |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 70%        | Same      | Different      |
| 50%        | Same      | Same           |
| 50%        | Different | Different      |
| 20%        | Different | Same           |

Note: Bulbapedia (Source used for most numbers) does not actually list a value for both species and trainer being different. The way the website is laid out, it appears like it's supposed ot be visually linked with the slot above so that is how it is listed. 

##### Egg groups

Egg groups are nominally similar biologies. Fish can breed with other fish, Mammals can breed with other mammals.

There are special groups.

Monster can belong to one or two egg groups

| Group | Types of creatures |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| Mineral | Inorganic |
| Amorphous | Think slimes |
| Grass | Plantlike |
| Water 1 | Amphibians |
| Water 2 | Fish |
| Water 3 | Aquatic invertibrates (Octopi, squid) |
| Bug | Insects |
| Dragon | Reptilian/draconic |
| Flying | Birds |
| Field | Standard ground animals. Kangaroos and dogs |
| Human-like | Bipedal |
| Fairy | Petite and cute |
| Monster | Dinosaurs/Kaijulike |
| Ditto | Can breed with any other egg group |
| Unbreedable | Unable to procreate |

##### Eggs

After every 256 steps, the timer on the egg decreases. The initial value of the timer is specified by the monster species.

Eggs hatch at level 5, and know moves based on parentage and what they would already know at level 5.

#### Obediance

Monster of too high a level will start doing things they aren't commanded to if the player doesn't have the appropriate badges.

| Level | Required Badges |
| ----- | --------------- |
| X<20 | Badge 1 |
| 20 <= X < 30 | Badge 2 |
| 30 <= X < 40 | Badge 3 |
| 40 <= X < 50 | Badge 4 |
| 50 <= X < 60 | Badge 5 |
| 60 <= X < 70 | Badge 6 |
| 70 <= X < 80 | Badge 7 |
| 80 <= X < 100 | Badge 8 |

`DA = Monster Level + Obedience cap) * R / 256`
- R is random value[0..255]
If DA is greater than Obedience cap, monster disobeys

If disobedient, use the same formula to get action disobedient monster takes

If DA < Obedience Cap, uses a random move that wasn't specified by trainer. If false, generate rand[0..255]

If Rand[0..255] < (Monster Level - Obedience cap), monster goes to sleep

Otherwise, if Rand[0..255] < 2 * (Monster Level - Obedience cap), monster does confusion damage to itself

#### Moves 

Moves are acquired by leveling up, using a TM or HM, Inheritance from breeding, and move tutor.

Moves have the following properties:
- Type: What it's effective and ineffective against
- Category: Physical, Special, or Status. Determines some effects and stats to use
- PP: Number of times  amove can be used before returning to a Swadgimon center
- Power: Determines the damage output of the move
- Accuracy: How likely an attack s to hit.

### Player

- Pronouns          (He/She/They/free entry)
- Gender            (Male, Female, Nonbinary, free entry)
- Sprite options    (Masculine, Feminine, Androgynous, furry)
- Name              (Free entry)
- Trainer ID        (Random 16 bit value)
- Secret ID         (Random 16 bit value)

### Battles

Battles are one of the core gameplay pillars, and prossibly the most important one. Battles are between 2-4 humans, who each have a maximum of 6 monsters that they can field at any time

#### Accuracy

Accuracy is is determined by the following formula:  
`If Rand[0..100] <= Move Accuracy * (Accuracy stage - Evasion Stage) * modifiers`
- Move accuracy is determined by the move being used \[1..100]
- Accuracy stage and Evasion stage inidicate a multiplier based on the temporary modificaiton. Max of +6 and min of -6. See [Stat Stages](#stat-stages)
- Modifiers such as weather, items, abilities etc.

##### Status moves

Self targeting status moves (Buffs, etc.) Do not need to roll for accuracy.

##### Exceptions

Some moves are auto hits. Accuracy formula can be subsittuted under special circumastances

#### Damage

Damage is a very long formula with a lot of variables:  
`DMG = (((2*L/5 + 2) * Power * A/D)/50 * Burn * Screen * Targets * Weather * FF + 2) * Stockpile * Crit * DblDmg * Charge * HH * STAB * Type1 * Type2 * Random`
- L: Monster's current level
- Power: Power of the move being used
- A: Attack (or Sp. Attack) stat of attacking monster
- D: Defense (or Sp. Defense) stat of defending monster
- Burn: 0.5 if defender is burned, move isn't guts, but is physical.
- Screen: 0.5 if using either relfect against physical attacks or Light screen against special attacks.
- Targets: In double battles, if a move hits two monsters, 0.5. 1 otherwise. Moves that hit all monsters also do 1.0, like earthquake.
- Weather: halves fire move in rain, doubles water type moves, reverse for Sunlight
- FF: If flash-fire triggered and is a fire type move, 1.5. Otherwise 1.0.
- Stockpile: If energy has been stockpiled, multiply by 2 or 3. Otherwise 1.
- Crit: 2 for a critical hit, 1 otherwise
- DblDmg: Specific moves trigger this if they do double damge. Example is doing earthquake while opponent is using dig
- Charge: 2 if the move is electric type and charge effect is active, 1.0 otherwise.
- HH: If helper in a douible battle has helping hand, 1.5. Otherwise, 1.0
- STAB: If the move's type matches either of the attacker's types, 1.5. Otherwise, 1.0
- Type1: Move's advantage or disadvantage versus the defenders's first type
- Type2: Move's advantage or disadvantage versus the defenders's second type
- Random: Gives some variablitiy. (Rand[0..15] + 85)/100

Note that a lot of these moves may not be implemented in Swadgimon. This can be seen as atemplate on how to add special damage effects.

#### Criticals

Criticals are based on stages, similar to stat stages below.

| Stage | Chance |
| ----- | ------ |
| 0 | 17/256 |
| 1 | 1/8 |
| 2 | 1/4 |
| 3 | 85/256 |
| 4+ | 1/2 |

Stages can be increased by holding certain items, using certain moves, etc.

#### Stat Stages

When a move or item increases or decreases a stat during battle, it changes the stage of that stat. Stages always reset when leaving battle.

For Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense and Speed:
| Stage | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| +6 | 8/2 |
| +5 | 7/2 |
| +4 | 6/2 |
| +3 | 5/2 |
| +2 | 4/2 |
| +1 | 3/2 |
|  0 | 2/2 |
| -1 | 2/3 |
| -2 | 2/4 |
| -3 | 2/5 |
| -4 | 2/6 |
| -5 | 2/7 |
| -6 | 2/8 |

For Accuracy and evasion:
| Stage | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| +6 | 300/100 |
| +5 | 266/100 |
| +4 | 250/100 |
| +3 | 200/100 |
| +2 | 166/100 |
| +1 | 133/100 |
|  0 | 100/100 |
| -1 |  75/100 |
| -2 |  60/100 |
| -3 |  50/100 |
| -4 |  43/100 |
| -5 |  36/100 |
| -6 |  33/100 |

#### Status Effects

Some moves casue status effects, or have a chance to cause a status effect. Non-Volitile statuses don't go away when the monster is switched out, Volitile do, and Transient statuses go away at the end of the turn.

Non-Volitile status are mutually exclusive. If one is already in effect, another cannot be gotten. NV status effects have badges assocated with them when viewing the monster.

Non-Volitile
| Name | Shorthand | Effect |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Burn | BRN | Inflicts 1/8th max HP per turn, physical move damage is halved. |
| Freeze | FRZ | Monster cannot use moves. Thaw chance is 20% per turn |
| Paralysis | PAR | Reduces Speed stat by 25%, 25% move failure chance. 
| Poison | PSN | Influcts 1/8th total HP each turn. Outside of battle, takes 1 ddmage every 4 steps. |

| Sleep | SLP | Sleep stops a monster from using moves for a random amount of turns, from 1-7. Self inflicted sleep is always 2 turns. |

No status flag for Volitile statuses, and they are not necesassary mutually exclusive. Volitile status can exist alongside a single Non-Volitile status.

See [this website](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Status_condition) for more details

#### Escape

Depending on the battle, the player may choose to run away from a battle with a wild monster. Success is determined by the following formula:  
`If Player_speed > Wild_speed`
-or-
`If Rand[0..255] < ((Speed_player * 128/Speed_wild) + 30 * attemtps)`
- Speed_player is the speed of the player's monster
- Speed_wild is the speed of the wild monster
- Attempts is the number of attempts to escape have been made

#### Catching Wild Monsters

If figthing a wild monster, the player can attempt to catch the monster. The capture attempt is run by the following formula:  
`X = (3 * MaxHP - 2 * CurrentHP)/3 * MaxHP * rate * Ball_Bonus * Status_Bonus`
- MaxHP: he full HP of the wild monster
- CurrentHP: The current value of the wild monster HP
- rate: Species based capture rate
- Ball_Bonus: Multiplier based on the ball used
- Status_Bonus: If the monster has a status condition, a bonus is applied based on condition.

If X is higher than 255, monster is automatically captured.

Otherwise, get a value from the folowing equation:  
`Y = 1048560/sqrt(sqrt(16711680/X))`  
The game then runs the following comparison four times:  
`Break out if Y >= rand[0..63353]`  
Ball wobbles each time the equation above is not met. On the fourth cycle, the monster is caught.

#### Fainting

If all your monsters faint, you also pass out and return to the last Swadgimon center you visited. Some of your money is lost.

#### Arena

Arenas are the space where monsters fight. They are blank voids with a 3/4th perpective on the monsters battling.

##### Doubles

Double battles involve up to four monsters at a time, two-on-two. Both monsters can be controlled by one player on one side, or they can be indiependantly controlled.

##### Weather

Weather effects are battle modifiers that can occur naturally depending on location, or by some of the moves mons can use.

| Name | Description | Effects |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| Harsh Sunlight | Sunbeams come from the sky | +50% fire move power, -50% water move power, monsters cannot be frozen |
| Rain | Raindrops fall from the sky | -50% fire move power, +50% water move power, |
| Sandstorm | Sand swirls around the screen | If ground, rock, or steel, +50% Special defense. Others take 1/16th max HP damage at the end of each turn unless mitigated by items or abilities |
| Hail | Thick white chunks of ice fall from the sky | If Ice type, +50% Special defense. Others take 1/16th max HP damage at the end of each turn unless mitigated by items or abilities |
| Strong winds | Leaves blow past | Electric, Ice and Rock type moves do neutral damage to Flying types |

### Multiplayer/Online/Event functionality

#### ID card

Players can set up an ID card so other players can see them and their teams.

#### Trading

Players can trade monsters. Both players are given full information on the other monster and given chances to back out if they think it's unfavorable.

#### Battling

Players can battle each other by connecting their swadges together remotely and agrees to a battle. The battle functions as any other battle would, but has to fetch both players move sets and agree on the random values before executing a turn.

    - Use ass kicking? Dark souls approach
    - Default Pokemon approach, block off paths until a story event is triggered
    - Warning popup when entering a difficult zone
- Tall grass analogue
    - Carpet, very plush
    - Crowds

### Trainer types
- Cosplayers A, B, C, D
- Fursuit dude
- Fursuit Gal
