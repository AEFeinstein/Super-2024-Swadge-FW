# Chowa Grove
A small pet simulator for Swadge 2025. 

The game is a small one-screen game that allows you to raise a pet Chowa that you can put into competitions, hang out with friends, dress up, and more!

Compare to Chao garden for SA2.

## What is a Chowa?
A small, defenseless creature that needs your help to become... something. A fighter, maybe? A speed demon? A Singer? It's up to you to help them reach their full potential.

Raise them well, as the evil Dr. Garbotnik is also raising his own Chowa, and he can't be up to any good.

Be sure to take care of your Chowa or they might run away to a better home.

Each Swadge can have up to 5 Chowa at once.

Chowa may get along with others based on a complicated formula I have yet to dream up. Probably along the following lines: `Cha1 * Cha2 * Mood1 * Mood2 * Similar skills + personality modifiers`

Chart showing who wins

| ----------------- | ----- | -------- | ---- | -------- | ------- |

Stages:
- Both Chowa start completely unready
- Depending on speed stat, they get ready for an attack
- Once ready, they wait for a short time
	- If both Chowa are ready before the time period ends, regular RPS happens
	- If one is unready, the unready one takes extra damage
- RPS is checked
- Damage is calculated based on Strength stat of attacking Chowa
- Agility is checked to see if the losing Chowa dodges
- Based on activities, drain some stamina
- Once stamina runs out, sit down and attempt to recover some stamina
- Readiness is reset

Player actions:
- Cheer Chowa: When regaining stamina, increase rate of regen
- Tell Chowa to get up: When regaining stamina, encourage them to stand back up and prepare to attack
- Pick fighting move: When preparing, influence move Chowa uses
- Dodge: When preparing, influence Chowa to dodge. Does less damage if preparing to dodge
- Forfeit: Any time, give up. Ask multiple times.

### Performance
Have a small dance-off against a fellow Chowa. Plays like Simon, use arrow keys in an ever increasing pattern. Have a cap on max moves by difficulty. Player is guiding Chowa to do the routine, so sometimes the Chowa will mess up.

There's a global timer, and once a sequence is input, a new sequence will spawn.

Score is based on number of completed sequences. Stats adjust how likely Chowa is to follow directions.

Sequences can use all four arrow keys and A and B.

Sequence:
- Song starts, score is set to 0
- Show a arrow/button on screen
- Buttons are "singing"
- Arrows are dancing
- Faster you press button, the higher the score
- Add anticipation? (DDR style, change from faster to more precise)

Chowa Stats:
- Str: No effect
- Agi: Dance modifier
- Cha: Sing modifier
- Spd: How long you have to press buttons
- Sta: No effect

### Racing
A footrace along an obstacle course.

Controls:
- Player can cheer the Chowa a few times per race, determined by Mood
- Player can give up anytime
