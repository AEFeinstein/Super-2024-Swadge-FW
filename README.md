## Documentation

Full Doxygen documentation is [hosted online here](https://adam.feinste.in/Swadge-IDF-5.0/). This details all APIs and has examples for how to use them. It was written to be referenced when writing Swadge modes.

The [Contribution Guide can be found here](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). It should be read before making a contribution.

Our [Code of Conduct](/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is simple, but worth reading and adhering to.

## Continuous Integration

This project uses Github Actions to automatically build the firmware, emulator, and documentation any time a change is pushed to main.
