## Documentation

Full documentation is [hosted online here](https://adam.feinste.in/Super-2024-Swadge-FW/). This details all APIs and has examples for how to use them. It was written to be referenced when writing Swadge modes. It also contains sections on setup, contribution, and conduct (which are individually linked below).

The [Configuring a Development Environment guide can be found here](/docs/SETUP.md). It will help you set up a development environment.

The [Contribution Guide can be found here](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). It should be read before making a contribution.

Our [Code of Conduct](/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is simple, but worth reading and adhering to.

## Continuous Integration

This project uses Github Actions to automatically build the firmware, emulator, and documentation any time a change is pushed to main.

## Troubleshooting

Reread [the documentation](https://adam.feinste.in/Super-2024-Swadge-FW/), then search the internet for your issue, then ask about it either in a Github issue or the Slack channel, #circuitboards. If your problem is solved, then the solution should be added to the documentation in the appropriate place.
